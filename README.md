# PyBer Rideshare Analysis
## Overview
Our goal is to help a rideshare company make informed decisions based upon analysis of data sets summarizing buisness in the past year. To begin, we aggregate all of the data given to us into a DataFrame which summarizes the parameters which will be important to our discussion. The resulting DataFrame is shown below in Figure 1.  Essentially, it the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type (rural, suburban or urban). To further summarize the data, the initial database is further sorted according to city types and the fares by city type over a section of the year is considered.

## Results

The figures below (2-7) summarize some trends which are of interest to the company. firstly, we have a DataFrame which includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare for each of the three city types, providing a decent summary of our initial analysis of the data. From this, it is clear that the Urban type city contributes the bulk of each of the "total" comlumns, whearas the Rural city type tends to have the highest average fare.

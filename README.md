# PyBer Rideshare Analysis
## Overview
Our goal is to help a rideshare company make informed decisions based upon analysis of data sets summarizing buisness in the past year. To begin, we aggregate all of the data given to us into a DataFrame which summarizes the parameters which will be important to our discussion. The resulting DataFrame is shown below in Figure 1.  Essentially, it the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type (rural, suburban or urban). To further summarize the data, the initial database is further sorted according to city types and the fares by city type over a section of the year is considered.

## Results

The figures below (2-7) summarize trends which are of interest to the company. Firstly, we have a scatter plot which provides a visual summary of the data: a scatter plot, which compares the average fare (y axis) to the 
total rides in a given city (x axis). The size of the point correlates to the number of drivers in the city, and the color indicates the type of city the data point belongs to. The visual summary confirms a trend that the urban rides tend to be more plentiful, but less costly, and in contrast, the rural rides tend to be more profitable per ride, but occur at a much slower rate.

Next, we a DataFrame which includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare for each of the three city types, providing a decent summary of our initial analysis of the data. From this, it is clear that the Urban type city contributes the bulk of each of the "total" comlumns, whearas the Rural city type tends to have the highest average fare.

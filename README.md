# PyBer Rideshare Analysis
## Overview
Our goal is to help a rideshare company make informed decisions based upon analysis of data sets summarizing buisness in the past year. To begin, we aggregate all of the data given to us into a DataFrame which summarizes the parameters which will be important to our discussion. The resulting DataFrame is shown below in Figure 1.  Essentially, it is a log of every ride taken, and includes the date/time of the ride, the township where the ride took place, the fare, the number of drivers in that township and finally, the type of township (rural, suburban or urban.) To further summarize the data, the initial database is further sorted according to city types and the fares by city type over a section of the year is considered
